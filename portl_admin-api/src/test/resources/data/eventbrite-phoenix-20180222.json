He regularly contributes to the New York Review of Books, the New York Times, the Guardian, and the New Statesman, and has written for too many international magazines and newspapers to list. In his latest book, The Age of Anger: A History of the Present (2017), Mishra casts his gaze back to the eighteenth century before leading us to the present to explain the origins of the great wave of paranoid hatreds that seem inescapable in our close-knit world: from American shooters and ISIS to Donald Trump, to a rise in vengeful nationalism across the world, to racism and misogyny on social media. Mishra was born in North India and completed his MA in English Literature at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi.His first book was Butter Chicken in Ludhiana: Travels in Small Town India (1995), a travelogue which described the social and cultural changes in India in the new context of globalization. His novel The Romantics (2000) an ironic tale of people longing for fulfillment in cultures other than their own, won the Los Angles Times’ Art Seidenbaum award for first fiction. His book An End to Suffering: The Buddha in the World (2004), mixes memoir, history, and philosophy while attempting to explore the Buddha’s relevance to contemporary times. Temptations of the West: How to be Modern in India, Pakistan and Beyond, describes Mishra’s travels through Kashmir, Bollywood, Afghanistan, Tibet, Nepal, and other parts of South and Central Asia.

Published in 2012, From the Ruins of Empire: The Revolt Against the West and the Remaking of Asia was shortlisted for the Lionel Gelber prize in Canada, the Orwell Prize in the U.K, and the Asia Society Bernard Schwartz Book Award in the United States. It won the Crossword Award for Best Nonfiction in 2013. In 2014, it became the first book by a non-Western writer to win Germany’s prestigious Leipzig Book Award for European Understanding. In 2013, he published A Great Clamour: Encounters with China and its Neighbours. Mishra was a visiting professor at Wellesley College in 2001, 2004, and 2006.

The App is available on Android & iPhone. With this App you scan the QR code found on a person's badge at the Expo. Once you scan the QR Code, that person's contact information that was provided to us when they registered will appear on your phone to save (i.e., First Name, Last Name, Email Address, Phone #, Company Name, Job Title & Zip Code). You can then put notes and mark the lead as Cold, Warm or Hot for future follow up. The App also allows you to export all of your scans into an Excel Spreadsheet that you can then upload into your CRM, Email Marketing Software, Contact Database, etc. For more info about our Lead Scanner App, please click HERE.\r\n\r\nHow do I use the Lead Scanner App?\r\nYou will receive a separate email from us with details on how to download and use the Lead Scanner App on your smartphone (along with your License Code).  It is only available on iPhone & Android Devices. You may scan as many attendee & exhibitor badges as you’d like.  All contact information from that scan will be provided (name, company, phone #, email address, job title & zip code). If you have any questions or need your License Code, please visit us in the Registration Area at the Expo.\r\nYou can also CLICK HERE for additional details on how to use our App.\r\n \r\nWhat is Beer & Biz Happy Hour?\r\nBeer & Biz Happy Hour takes place on the Small Business Expo Exhibitor Floor from 3:30 pm-4:30 pm. Free Beer will be provided at the VIP Bar for Exhibitors and Attendees with a Gold, Platinum or Titanium Badge. We crank up the music, add Beer and everyone has a great time with some last minute networking! Please note you must be 21 years or older to consume alcohol. \r\n \r\nI want access to the Beer & Biz Happy Hour & the Lead Scanner App!\r\nGreat! Please purchase the Gold, Platinum or Titanium Badge.  These badges include both options (see the Badge Chart above for other items included with these badges). Please note you must be 21 years or older to consume alcohol and use the Open Bar.\r\n \r\nWhat is the PRICE and what is the FEE listed on the Eventbrite options?\r\nThe \"PRICE\" is what Small Business Expo charges for that specific Badge Option. The \"FEE\" is the Eventbrite Registration processing fee. Eventbrite is a 3rd Party Registration company that we use to allow you to register for our events. \r\n \r\nI already purchased a badge but would like to upgrade to a higher level. What do I do?\r\nPlease purchase the higher level option and then contact us by email or by phone at 212.404.2345 and we will refund your other badge.  You must purchase the higher level badge first before requesting a refund for the other badge.\r\n \r\nCan I update my registration contact information?\r\nYes. Any updates to your contact information may be made when you arrive at the Expo in our Registration Area.  We are unable to make changes over the phone or online.\r\n \r\nWill my Entrance Badge be emailed or mailed to me before the Expo?\r\nNo.  You will need to check-in with us at the Expo in our Registration Area.  We will print your badge on-site and provide you with a lanyard/clip and badge holder.  We do recommend that you print and bring your EventBrite Confirmation with QR Code for quick & expedited check-in.\r\n \r\nDo I have to bring my printed EventBrite Confirmation to the event?\r\nNo, but we do recommend it.  We are able to look you up by your name and/or email address at the Expo.  However, bringing your EventBrite Confirmation with QR Code will speed up your check-in process.\r\n \r\nVIP Reserved Seating - how does that work?\r\nAll of our workshop rooms & the Main Stage will have a row of seats reserved just for you.  Please be sure to always have your badge displayed for access to these reserved seats.  Your badge gives you access to these seats, no other ticket is needed. This option is only available for Platinum & Titanium Badge Holders.\r\n \r\nWhat is Priority Seating in Speed Networking?\r\n Speed Networking is one of our most popular areas of the show. Like \"Speed Dating\" you get approximately 3 mins to exchange information and network with one person. When the bell goes off, you move to the next table and meet someone different. This is a quick way to meet about 20 new people in 45-60 minutes. Priority Seating is available for Titanium Badge Holders first, followed by everyone else. This area of the Expo tends to sell out so we highly recommend purchasing a Titanium Badge if you plan to participate in this part of the show. When you arrive at the Expo and get your Badge, your Badge will give you access to Priority Seating in this area. Please look for the Priority Seating line when you arrive at this area. Priority Seating badge holders will be seated first.\r\n \r\n \r\nWhat is the company promo offer in the post-show \"thank you\" email included in my Titanium badge? \r\nAfter the Expo, we will send out a special \"THANK YOU\" email to all of our registered attendees. As a Titanium Badge-Holder, we include your logo, contact Info, company description, link to your website and a special offer (optional). Please send this information to Andres@theshowproducers.com. Click Here to view a sample of this email.\r\n \r\n \r\nThe name on my registration doesn't match the attendee. Is that okay?\r\nYes, you may update this information on-site in our Registration Area the day of the Expo.  We are unable to make changes to your registration over the phone or online.\r\n \r\nShould I bring business cards to the event? Are flyers and other ads permitted?\r\nAbsolutely bring business cards, and lots of them! This is a huge networking event, we encourage networking and exchanging of business cards.  Flyers and other advertisements may not be given away unless you are an approved exhibitor.  However, you may display your business cards, flyers & other advertisements free of charge in our designated Business Card Exchange Area.\r\n \r\nMay I solicit my product/service to Expo Exhibitors and Sponsors?\r\nNo. We have a strict No Solicitation policy.  Please do not solicit your product/service to Exhibitors & Sponsors unless you are an Exhibitor/Sponsor with proper Exhibitor/Sponsor credentials listed on your badge. Violators will be asked to leave.  We thank you in advance for your cooperation.  If you would like to sell your product/service at the Expo, we encourage you to purchase an exhibitor space at the Expo.\r\n \r\nI want to Exhibit and/or Sponsor Small Business Expo!\r\nGreat!

The App is available on Android &amp; iPhone. With this App you scan the QR code found on a person's badge at the Expo.

You can then put notes and mark the lead as Cold, Warm or Hot for future follow up. The App also allows you to export all of your scans into an Excel Spreadsheet that you can then upload into your CRM, Email Marketing Software, Contact Database, etc. For more info about our Lead Scanner App, please click <A HREF=\"https://www.thesmallbusinessexpo.com/app/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">HERE</A>.</SPAN></P>\r\n<P DIR=\"ltr\" STYLE=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><BR></P>\r\n<P DIR=\"ltr\" STYLE=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">How do I use the Lead Scanner App?</SPAN></P>\r\n<P DIR=\"ltr\" STYLE=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: medium; font-family: Verdana; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">You will receive a separate email from us with details on how to download and use the Lead Scanner App on your smartphone (along with your License Code).  It is only available on iPhone &amp; Android Devices.

This is a quick way to meet about 20 new people in 45-60 minutes. Priority Seating is available for Titanium Badge Holders first, followed by everyone else. This area of the Expo tends to sell out so we highly recommend purchasing a Titanium Badge if you plan to participate in this part of the show. When you arrive at the Expo and get your Badge, your Badge will give you access to Priority Seating in this area. Please look for the Priority Seating line when you arrive at this area.

Plus, there’s no ringing in your ears when you leave!</P>\n<P>**By attending our parties you are subjected to photos and videos being used in our promotional efforts via our website, social media and print marketing.**</P>"},"id":"42688610784","url":"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/urban-fetes-presents-silent-party-phoenix-ii-tickets-42688610784?aff=ebapi","vanity_url":"https://silentpartyphx.eventbrite.com","start":{"timezone":"America/Phoenix","local":"2018-02-23T21:30:00","utc":"2018-02-24T04:30:00Z"},"end":{"timezone":"America/Phoenix","local":"2018-02-24T02:00:00","utc":"2018-02-24T09:00:00Z"},"organization_id":"16362198213","created":"2018-01-30T21:01:08Z","changed":"2018-02-22T23:19:40Z","capacity":450,"capacity_is_custom":true,"status":"live","currency":"USD","listed":true,"shareable":true,"online_event":false,"tx_time_limit":480,"hide_start_date":false,"hide_end_date":false,"locale":"en_US","is_locked":false,"privacy_setting":"unlocked","is_series":false,"is_series_parent":false,"is_reserved_seating":false,"source":"create_2.0","is_free":false,"version":"3.0.0","logo_id":"40268979","organizer_id":"1911013103","venue_id":"22544901","category_id":"103","subcategory_id":"3008","format_id":"11","resource_uri":"https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/events/42688610784/","category":{"resource_uri":"https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/categories/103/","id":"103","name":"Music","name_localized":"Music","short_name":"Music","short_name_localized":"Music"},"logo":{"crop_mask":{"top_left":{"x":0,"y":30},"width":960,"height":480},"original":{"url":"https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F40268979%2F16362198213%2F1%2Foriginal.jpg?s=a49b0eb289e6b03cfdc6c5745ce49d26","width":960,"height":540},"id":"40268979","url":"https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F40268979%2F16362198213%2F1%2Foriginal.jpg?h=200&w=450&rect=0%2C30%2C960%2C480&s=a451ba0c2f245ef1faf7a3c81eeed4c7","aspect_ratio":"2","edge_color":"#14100e","edge_color_set":true},"venue":{"address":{"address_1":"122 East Washington Street","address_2":null,"city":"Phoenix","region":"AZ","postal_code":"85004","country":"US","latitude":"33.4485956","longitude":"-112.07187859999999","localized_address_display":"122 East Washington Street, Phoenix, AZ 85004","localized_area_display":"Phoenix, AZ","localized_multi_line_address_display":["122 East Washington Street","Phoenix, AZ 85004"]},"resource_uri":"https://www.eventbriteapi.com/v3/venues/22544901/","id":"22544901","age_restriction":null,"capacity":null,"name":"Monarch Theatre","latitude":"33.4485956","longitude":"-112.07187859999999"}}],"location":{"latitude":"33.440000","within":"16.0934400061","longitude":"-112.070000"}}
