      "description": "<p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>Im just reaching out to give you a great resource. June 1 is World Narcissistic Abuse Awareness Day. You can learn more at www.wnaad.com</p> <p>On this day, there is a full day of free online workshops on the topic of narcissism with lots of incredible speakers including Melania Tonia Evans, Sam Vaknin, and Lisa Romano....and myself. I am doing a talk on how to heal narcissistic abuse.</p> <p>I listened in to all the podcasts last year and they really were informative and worth the time. I'm super excited to be part of the speaker lineup this year!</p> <p>Heres the link for signing up:<br/><a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/6efdd24a72cd/survivorempowermenttelesummitsignup\" class=\"linkified\">https://mailchi.mp/6efdd24a72cd/survivorempowermenttelesummitsignup</a></p> <p>Sign up now to get them for free for two days (June 1 and June 2) You can even just download them all and save them to listen later. I believe they charge for them when you get to the day of the event.</p> <p>Feel free to share this with anyone you know that might be interested!</p> <p>Also, I'm forming a live weekly online support group for narcissistic abuse - (like a skype group) This will be available only for Washington and Oregon residents. This will be similar to the format of our in person narcissistic abuse support group that has been running for the last five years. If you are interested in joining the group, email me at [masked]</p>",

Do you despair of ever changing?</p> <p>By changing our energy, we can change the patterns in our subconscious mind.

When you go deep inside, and ask this question, what comes up? And do you know what you want instead?

      "description": "<p>Let's meet up at Dice Age Games on East Fourth Plain Blvd. in Vancouver. It has a spacious gaming area, snacks and a large game library. They also serve beer, hard cider and soft drinks. Anyway, as it says on their website: Dice Age Games is a game and hobby shop in Vancouver, WA. We are located on East Fourth Plain Blvd right next to Golden Skate. Dice Age opened their doors to the community on May 2nd, 2011. We strive to deliver the best selection of board games, war games, RPGs, CCGs, collectible miniatures, dice, and hobby supplies.</p> <p>And in order to ensure that gamers that arrive a little later have a chance to get in on the fun, let's try to reserve the first hour or two of gameplay (5 pm to 7ish) for games that take an hour or less to learn and play. Not a rule, just a suggestion. Thanks :)</p>",

      "description": "<p>Pedalpalooza is back! YEAH! It's time to have fun on bikes! There are a ton of fun rides posted on <a href=\"http://www.shift2bikes.org\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.shift2bikes.org</a> and they start now, even before the official Pedalpalooza start date of June 1st! Look on the calendar when you get to that page!</p> <p>This Meetup is about the main kickoff ride which welcomes all riders and is a great chance to spread the word about any rides you're leading, and learn more about rides you want to attend.</p> <p>Meet at Seawall Crest Park at 6pm and roll it slow and sassy at 7pm. After about 15 miles of parade style bike fun, we'll convene at a park for hang out time.</p> <p>For those of you not familiar with the Portland Bicycle community and their many organized rides here are some tips:</p> <p>1. BRING BEVERAGES, SNACKS, MONEY TO BUY MORE: It is always appropriate to bring snacks and beverages for yourself or to share. People often bring adult beverages and if consumed discretely and in moderation this should not be a problem. However safety should be your top priority so, particularly if you haven't ridden a bicycle for a while, you might want to save the consumption of adult beverages until after the ride is over.</p> <p>2. HELMET HELMET HELMET: While bicycle riding is generally a safe sport, and safer when you are in a sea of 100+ bicycles which are highly visible to automobiles, an occasional tumble can happen. I cannot emphasize enough that you should ALWAYS WEAR A HELMET! (I took an unexpected fall back in September, on a bicycle path no less, and I am extremely glad I was wearing a helmet at the time. If anyone wants to see my cracked helmet, just ask!) Many people in the Portland Bicycle Community do not wear helmets and as adults they can make that choice, but please don't be one of them. You can replace your helmet, you can't replace your brain.</p> <p>3. DRESS FOR THE WEATHER: Wear layers that you can put on or take off as needed. Have something water proof or water resistant for your outer layer. The ride goes rain or shine. TIP: Throw a few plastic trash bags in you back pack - these can be used as rain ponchos and to keep gear dry.</p> <p>4. LIGHTS LIGHTS LIGHTS!: I put 9pm as the end time - but it could end sooner. However just plan that you might be out past dark and have a front and back light on your bicycle. The more lights the better.</p> <p>I have these bicycle LED lights on my bicycle wheels and I am very happy with them: \"YYGIFT Waterproof 20 LED Bicycle Wheel Light String Safety Cool Bike Wheel Light for Night Safe Cycling - Working with 3AA Batteries\" You will find these on Amazon for $9.49 a strand (you need at least two strands - one for each wheel, but buy three so you have a spare.) Shipping is free on this items - with or without Amazon prime! (Note: they are made for a smaller children's bicycle wheel so there will be a small gap of a few inches but this is actually a good thing as it gives you a space where you can put your lock without touching the delicate wire.)</p> <p>5. LOCK LOCK LOCK: Yes bicycle theft is a chronic problem in PDX. Even locked bicycles are at risk, but a lock is better than nothing. So get the best lock you can afford.</p> <p>6. EXTRAS: Also a good idea to carry extra air tubes that fit your bicycle and a pump to inflate. Bring tools if you have them, but there is usually some seasoned bicycle rider on these rides who will help you if you get a flat tire. Also, if you are a member of AAA, in Oregon and Idaho, AAA offers the extra service of rescuing bicycle riders in distress. I'm not sure if that means they will change your tire, but they will at least come and get you.</p> <p>7: CAMERA: There are usually good photo opportunities on these rides. Take pictures and post your best shots here on this meetup so we can share your experience!</p>",

For all of us, the seven major chakras are the energetic gateways through which body, mind and spirit come together, literally embodying the soul.</p> <p>In Chakradance classes and courses, each of these seven chakras has its own unique body of wonderfully danceable music, resonating to its own specific vibrational frequencies.</p> <p>On one level, Chakradance can be experienced as a joyful affirmation of who you truly are. Using spontaneous dance, creativity and your imagination, it leads to an awakening, a discovery of your true self.</p> <p>But at a deeper level, Chakradance is also about healing and balance. By surrendering to the music of each chakra, we dance from the inside out and find ourselves awakening and healing ancient hurts; expressing – often for the first time – long-blocked emotions; and opening ourselves up to levels of spiritual connection higher than we ever thought possible.</p> <p>This is what we mean when we describe Chakradance™ as “rhythm for your soul”. Think of it as a 'dynamic moving meditation to music'... or as 'the musical sister of yoga' (without the set-piece poses or asanas).</p> <p>There is no right or wrong way to move your body. It’s a journey of self-discovery. Each chakra is explored through specific music, guided imagery and your own free, improvised dance, done in a candle-lit space with your eyes softly closed. This begins to activate inner experiences.</p> <p>Chakradance puts you in touch with the sacred within yourself. It helps you re-connect with your own soul, unique and beautiful. Dancing the seven chakras is like dancing into seven different worlds, seven different facets of your whole self, each with their own lessons, meanings and stories.

But first, we’ll catch the tail-end of low altitude wildflower season with a 7 mile loop through scenic Dalles Mountain Ranch!</p> <p>*Scrambling photo of Katya and me from my Instagram*</p> <p>Difficulty: Easy, possibly moderate for Dalles Mountain;<br/>Moderate for scrambling up Horsethief Butte</p> <p>Hiking distance: About 9 miles total, 7 of which are easy wildflower hiking</p> <p>Elevation gain: 1310 feet for Dalles Mountain, plus 250 feet of easy scrambling for Horsethief Butte</p> <p>Total time: Let’s try to get back by 4</p> <p>Permits: No Discover Passes required for this Saturday</p> <p>Gas: 174 mile RT drive, so $17 suggested to drivers for gas, unless drivers determine otherwise</p> <p>Dogs: Not on this one, due to the Horsethief Butte section</p> <p>The Dalles Mountain Ranch trail network is a real treat, and props to NW Wilderness leader Barbara for bringing this area to my attention last year. In addition to the remaining lupine and balsamroot blooms, we’ll hike past streams, rocky outcroppings, ranch buildings, heart-filling views of the Gorge, and even a waterfall.</p> <p>We won’t stop for lunch, though, until the final section of our event. Just south of Dalles Mountain Ranch are the climbing crags of Horsethief Bluff, a popular spot for climbing instructors to test their students’ verticals skills. We’ll find a short, moderate scrambling route through the rocks to hit the high point for our lunch, served with a sweet view of the eastern Columbia River Gorge.</p> <p>Here is more information about this area: <a href=\"https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/columbia-hills-state-park\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/columbia-hills-state-park</a></p> <p>My preferred hiking style is brisk (3-3.5 mph when not running), but let’s see how it goes. We’ll enjoy short breaks as needed for snacks, photos, and viewpoints. There is no such thing as too many photo opps.</p> <p>Bring: Lunch, sturdy shoes or boots, water, snacks, warm layers, a rain jacket, and a camera</p> <p>It is also recommended that hikers always carry the Ten Essentials:<br/>1. Navigation (map, compass, and an awareness of our route)<br/>2. Sun protection (sunglasses and sunscreen)<br/>3. Insulation (extra clothing)<br/>4. Illumination (headlamp/flashlight and extra batteries)<br/>5. First-aid supplies<br/>6. Fire (waterproof matches/lighter/candles)<br/>7. Knife/tools<br/>8. Nutrition (extra food)<br/>9. Hydration (extra water)<br/>10. Emergency whistle and general preparedness in the event that you become separated from our group and/or have to spend the night in the wild.</p> <p>PARTICIPATE AT YOUR OWN RISK; NW Wilderness Group organizers are volunteers. We come prepared to lead you on a trail or off trail hike but assume no liability for your safety getting to or from the trail-head or on the hike.

      "description": "<p>Bells Mountain Hike</p> <p>Start point: Moulton Falls Upper TrailheadEnd point: Cedar Creek BridgeTrail Log:Hike Type: In and out Distance: 15.6 milesElevation gain: 3040 feet</p> <p>The Bells Mountain Trail has been designated part of a 31-mile “National Recreation Trail” which begins at the Hantwick Road Trailhead and ends at the Bluff Mountain Trailhead. This moniker is slightly ironic as there is no trail in our area that takes in so many clearcuts and brand-new logging roads; in this respect, and because of destructive ATV incursions, it has been declared an “endangered” trail by the Washington Trails Association. The trail was constructed by the Chinook Trail Association, using a substantial grant, which has included it in their vision for a 300-mile loop trail around the Columbia Gorge. From the clearcuts, there are great views on a fine day of the Dole Valley, back to Yacolt, Kloochman Butte, Larch Mountain, Silver Star Mountain, Mount Saint Helens, and Mount Adams. Wildflowers will be out in the spring and the second half of the hike runs along quiet Cedar Creek.</p> <p>A car shuttle is possible in the spring and summer when the road to Cold Creek Trailhead is open.</p> <p>WARNING: Pay attention to temporary signs posted at the trailheads and junctions. There is frequent logging activity along this trail. The trail may be closed at some points, entirely closed, or closed on weekdays.</p> <p>You can visit both Moulton Falls and Yacolt Falls before crossing the East Fork on the high bridge and heading down the East Fork Lewis River Greenway on the “baby stroller” trail on the old railroad grade. To reach the bridge from the Moulton Falls Trailhead, walk on the path next to the highway and then cut in past a shed and traverse up the hill to the bridge. From the Moulton Falls Upper Trailhead, which has many more parking spaces, drop in Douglas-fir woods with a sword fern, salal, Oregon grape, and salmonberry understory to a junction. Go left here and head up to cross the East Fork High Bridge and get a bird’s eye view of the gorge on both sides.</p> <p>Keep straight on the wide, flat railroad grade to pass another picnic area down to the right. Get a view through the alders and cedars to little Moulton Falls pushing through its cleft. Pass under a rock face and then through an alley of red alder. Drop gently to a footbridge and, a few yards later, come to the Moulton Falls-Bells Mountain Trail Junction, with its kiosk and signboard indicating 7.2 miles to Cold Creek.</p> <p>Go left here, rise up the slopes of Bells Mountain, and switchback in mossy Douglas-fir, big-leaf maple, and alder woods with a sword fern carpet. Then the trail makes a descending traverse and crosses a footbridge above a small waterfall. Ascend in three switchbacks and come to the 0.5 mile marker (You will see these DNR half-mile posts the length of the hike). Keep left at a junction with a trail that leads down to a clearcut. Cross a footbridge at a spring sprouting skunk-cabbage and keep rising to pass your first clearcut of the day. There’s a view back down the Dole Valley to Yacolt from here. Reenter a stand of forest left along a creek and then enter a replanted clearcut, crossing the end of a logging spur. Enter leafy woods again, cross a creek and come to another clearcut (It should be said that the clearcuts leaf out with lush shrubbery and blooms in the spring and early summer, making the trip a little more palatable). Navigate the slope, cross another forested creek drainage, and meet a large clearcut, hike across it, and then enter a Douglas-fir plantation. Cross a bulrush-hemmed stream at the 2.5 mile marker and make a gentle descent to a logging road. Go right for 15 yards and resume the trail, which drops alongside and alder-shaded creek. Join an old road bed and descend to switchback down to a sturdy footbridge over the creek which runs between Bells and Spotted Deer Mountains.</p> <p>The trail rises in mossy secondary forest, crossing above a spring in an alder-shaded bowl. Enter a recent clearcut with a view back to Bells Mountain. Cross a newly decommissioned logging road and pass through two forested creek corridors at Milepost 4.0 before hitting clearcut slopes again. The trail reaches a road. Here you need to head 200 yards up to the left before finding the resumption of the path. Hike across another wide swath of clearcut slope with views ahead to Silver Star Mountain. Pass through a tree island and reach a road. Go right 15 yards and find the trail one more time. Alternate more clearcut and forested corridors before reaching a clearcut slope with a direct view to Larch Mountain. The trail has been rerouted down the left side of this cut and then angles down to cross an abandoned ATV track that parallels Cedar Creek.</p> <p>The rest of the hike heads up the creek, sometimes crossing or using the ATV track. Posts have been set to prevent ATVs from taking the foot trail. The lush woods along the creek are comprised of Douglas-fir, western hemlock, western red-cedar, red alder, and big-leaf maple interspersed with skunk-cabbage bogs. Footbridges cross the tributaries to Cedar Creek. Where the ATV track fords Cedar Creek, head up a sword fern slope, and then traverse down to creek level. The trail rises again in mossy woods of older Douglas-fir, cedar, and hemlock. Drop to a boggy area of devil’s club, skunk-cabbage, and salmonberry. At about Milepost 7.0, get views of the Cold Creek Day-use Area across Cedar Creek. Switchback down from the edge of a clearcut, cross a creek, and hike on the level to the large “continental bridge” over Cedar Creek to reach the Cedar Creek Bridge.</p> <p>This is a good turn around point. To the right is a small viewing platform at a pretty scene: tall conifers shade a short drop in the cold, clear waters of the creek and you might observe a dipper bobbing for insects in the spate. From the junction, the Bells Mountain Trail continues another 0.6 miles to its junction with the Tarbell Trail. If you are doing a car shuttle, it’s 0.2 miles on a universal trail to the Cold Creek Day-use Area.</p>",

Salmon Slab is a pretty low key climbing area. It has five routes on it that range from 5.5 to 5.9. None of the routes are terribly long and there is good visibility of the climber from the ground so we should have fun. This is a great opportunity for people who have never climbed outdoors before.</p> <p>What you'll need<br/>Shoes<br/>Harness<br/>Helmet<br/>Belay device<br/>Locking carabiner<br/>Food and water</p> <p>If you have a rope that would be great, too, but not necessary.</p> <p>Also, please be aware that if there are no clouds the sun will be beating the heck out of us come noon so sun screen and fluids are a good idea, too.</p> <p>For those of you who go to Planet Granite you're likely used to using GriGris. I'm not sure how many, if any, we will have. They have an introduction to climbing class at Portland Rock Gym where they teach you to use an ATC, which is less expensive than a GriGri. In any event, you should be comfortable with top rope belaying before signing up for this even.</p> <p>I also want to emphasize that those of us organizing this are not professional climbers. We just really like it and also like introducing people to it. Having said that, I can't stress enough the benefit of hiring a professional to teach you things. We will do everything we can to keep people safe but please be aware that rock climbing is an inherently dangerous sport and there is always a risk associated with it.

Leaders are volunteers and receive no portion of event fees. We carpool to most outdoor events and expect passengers to contribute to the cost of transportation, permits and any parking passes. Standard Mazamas rate is 10 cents/mile/person, though contributions are at the discretion of drivers.</p> <p>All AYM leaders have First Aid training and are vetted by our committee for their skills and experience. Participants must follow leader instructions in order to protect group safety. Leaders reserve the right to only include participants who are adequately prepared, amicable and safe.</p> <p>Please treat other participants with respect and consideration. Many of our events have more people wishing to participate than we can accommodate. Only RSVP yes if you are committed to attending.</p> <p>Meetup provides a platform for people to become friends through shared interests and activities. Part of building trust and friendship starts with using an identifiable profile photo of yourself, so people know who you are and we can find each other - especially when meeting the first time.</p> <p>This is a group to meet friends for outdoor adventures, not a dating site. To join, others must feel comfortable and safe with you. On social media, please follow us on Facebook and Instagram (aympdx) where you can also see many pictures from our events.</p> <p><img src=\"http://creelan.multics.org/fire2.jpg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8544/8710789774_9133c0c015_k_d.jpg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c6/50/66/c650661f2563172c55c3f6259842f2a7.jpg\" /> <img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8280/8709664837_355dcdf560_k_d.jpg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/E6O8WJ7Ps9hCm8qOSHMu1A/o.jpg\" /></p>",

We are a spiritual circle within Leaven Community and average 10-20 people a week.</p> <p>Join us Saturday mornings from 9:00 to 10:30am. No prior meditation experience needed, just come as you are and be prepared to learn something new about yourself!</p> <p>Meditation sessions last 50 minutes and include opportunity for sitting, walking/movement. A group discussion follows on a topic introduced by the week's discussion leader. Afterwards we enjoy refreshments and casual conversations as we get to know one another and deepen relationships.</p> <p>By coming together each week we strengthen our mindfulness practice, enjoy community, and develop a more mindful outlook with which to live and act in our interconnected world. <a href=\"http://leaven.org\" class=\"linkified\">http://leaven.org</a></p>",

FIXED leashes 6ft. or shorter are required. You will not be able to join the walk with a flexi leash.</p> <p>$10 per dog, cash or Venmo.</p> <p>VENMO OPTION:<br/>Search for \"The Balanced Dog\" or[masked] to pay via card.</p> <p>This group was started by our pack leader, Lyndsi. She found that during her training sessions with reactive dogs there weren't enough triggers within the neighborhood to get the dog the exposure, and repetition it needed to effectively reinforce positive social behaviors. She thought it would be great to have everyone come together to help each other!</p> <p>Pack walk begins with a brief overview of basic desensitization techniques for anyone who needs support or is unsure of what techniques to use for their dog. During this time please maintain 6 ft. from dogs until bandanas are on and we understand each other’s needs. We accept that everyone comes from different backgrounds and different trainers and we encourage you to use techniques that work best for you and your dog. Lyndsi tries to bring new tips each week to ensure that each individual gets the knowledge they need. Please bring your treat pouches and the treats that your dog thinks are the best treats in the whole world!</p> <p>We use a colored bandana system to create a safe environment for both owners and dogs. Bandanas are provided at the beginning of each walk.</p> <p>Green= Dogs who are comfortable being greeted by people and other dogs.</p> <p>Yellow= Dogs who are frightful of people, but comfortable meeting new dogs.</p> <p>Red= Dogs who are reactive with people and other dogs— so we know to give space.</p> <p>This is a journey for both you and your dog! We are here to support you so please push through your butterflies and join us, we promise you won’t regret it.</p> <p>We strive to make this a safe, positive, fun, supportive and educational experience for everyone who comes.</p> <p>Please message us if you have any questions or concerns and we look forward to seeing you at the next pack walk! Let your journey begin!</p> <p>IMPORTANT!<br/>AGAIN, No flexi leashes. NONE!</p> <p>Refund Policy<br/>This is a deeply discounted training class. Please give 24 hours notice if you would like to receive a refund or have your payment credited to another walk. This gives us time to fill your spot. Thank you!</p>",

Today, the historic core of old Willamette features a vibrant concentration of shops, restaurants and other services; and a compact 16 block National Register residential historic district.</p> <p>We’ll explore the attractive, pedestrian friendly main street and walk through the historic residential area viewing some well-preserved late Victorian and Craftsman architecture.

      "description": "<p>Marsha is leading us in learning how to create Vision Boards, sometimes called Dream Boards, a fun tool for self-discovery. These projects can help you uncover ideas or goals and focus on what you want in your life, whether it is a feeling, a destination, a specific project, or an actual material product.</p> <p>Creating and using vision boards serves several purposes, some of which include helping you to:</p> <p>* Identify your vision and give it clarity.<br/>* Reinforce your daily affirmations.<br/>* Keep your attention on your intentions.</p> <p>Vision Boards Help Provide Clarity:</p> <p>For example, to say “I want a better life” is a fine goal, but have you given serious thought to exactly what that means? Try to envision what your “better life” looks like. For those of us who find that somewhat difficult, making a vision board can be a tremendous help.</p> <p>In order to create my vision board, I must actively seek images that represent specific details of this wonderful new life. That means narrowing it down to specifics.</p> <p>For some, a better life might mean having a new car or home.</p> <p>Others may be seeking a new relationship or improvements in existing relationships.</p> <p>Doubtless you have heard it said that most of us never get what we want because we don’t know what we want. Making a vision board is a wonderful way to bring clarity to that general desire and turn it into an achievable goal.</p> <p>• What to bring</p> <p>* Glue sticks, several. Tape runners or your other favorite adhesive is fine.<br/>* Poster board, artist board, or some other strong surface.<br/>* Cutting tools; scissors, X-acto, etc.<br/>* Images and words that speak to you, bring more than you need!<br/>* Washi tape (optional, but fun)<br/>* Magazines to share with everyone if you have some to spare.</p> <p>• Important to know</p> <p>Marsha will be offering some poster board for folks who don't have any. While she's demonstrating how to make Vision Boards on poster board, she will be talking about other options as well.</p> <p>Some of the text describing Vision Boards was referenced from: <a href=\"https://www.makeavisionboard.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.makeavisionboard.com</a></p>",

      "description": "<p>Historic Willamette was established in 1893 upriver from Oregon City on the west side of the Willamette River. Over the next decade Willamette became the home for hundreds of power plant and mill workers and their families. The need for safe drinking water led to annexation by West Linn in 1916. Today, the historic core of old Willamette features a vibrant concentration of shops, restaurants and other services; and a compact 16 block National Register residential historic district.</p> <p>We’ll the explore attractive, pedestrian friendly main street and walk through the historic residential area viewing some well-preserved late Victorian and Craftsman architecture. After the tour join us for optional food and beverage in one of the many dining choices along main street.</p> <p>Easy urban walk of less than 2 miles in about 2 hours.</p> <p>The fee for this narrated tour is $15.

      "description": "<p>We head to Mary S Young Park for a summer day of running and playing in the Willamette River. This park has something for everyone! The Walk is level, and can vary in length for your doggo's age and health, there is an off-leash play park for high-energy dogs to run, and we'll be stopping by the Willamette to cool off!</p> <p>The Walk itself is a little over 2 miles, and will take two hours with stops to run and play. Please continue to obey leash rules (both for the group, and the park) while on the trails. There's plenty of opportunity to run off-leash at the park and on the river.</p> <p>We will be playing at the off-leash park before and after the hike, so please join in!</p> <p>Our monthly Pack Walks are fun, social, outdoor walks with our dogs between 2-4 miles, in and around the Portland OR metro area. The monthly walk is scheduled the first Saturday, at 10:00, with changing locations.</p> <p>Who is welcome? Everyone, and every dog is welcome.</p> <p>My dog is learning social skills, can she come? Yes. Group walks can help your dog learn to socialize as they bond over common goals and release anxiety through exercise. The group is very understanding, and will give your dog all the space she/he needs.</p> <p>There are shy dogs and very friendly dogs in the group. My dog is an aussie, and he likes to bark to tell me what's happening. Other dogs hang out at the edge of the group and wonder what the fuss is about. Once walking though, all the dogs like to bump shoulders and sniff around together.</p> <p>What kinds of dogs come? All kinds of dogs and humans enjoy they walks - everything from big, poofy Bernese mountain dogs to little, poofy Pomeranians.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Drop by on Saturday morning for writing, support, and motivation from fellow writers! It's pretty informal: we'll do some introductions, chat about what we're working on, write for around 25 minutes on whatever you want, chat for a few minutes about how it went, and then write for another 25 minutes! Sometimes we'll do additional blocks of writing if folks are up for it.</p> <p>There are no expectations - no sharing/workshopping/critique (but it can be an opportunity to connect with others in the group to do this on the side). Feel free to come late - if the group is already writing when you arrive, just take a seat and start writing and we can have a chat during one of the breaks. The important thing is to show up for and commit to your writing in a positive and supportive environment!</p> <p>People with marginalized gender identities are welcome.</p>",

      "description": "<p>The 4T will be started at the Oregon Zoo/Washington Park Max Station. The four-miles hike, and tram, trolley, and train take between three and four hours to complete. Near the trolley stop, in front of downtown’s Central Library, is the nearby food carts. So let's grab a bite to eat after building up a healthy appetite, so bring some money for lunch.</p> <p>The hiking section is approximately 4 miles with about 600 feet in elevation gain. The pace will be fast (3 to 3.5 miles an hour), so you should be very comfortable with hiking. Bring water with you.</p> <p>You can park in the zoo parking lot ($8) or take MAX from another location. I'm parking for free at the Sunset Transit Station and coming over from there.</p> <p>A Tri-Met all day pass costs $5 and will cover riding the MAX Light Rail (the train) and Portland Street Car (the trolley). If we weren't getting lunch I would say we could do the 2 1/2 hour pass ($2.50), but that's pushing it.</p> <p>Events start promptly at time indicated. Bring rain gear if it rains.</p> <p>For more information go to:<br/><a href=\"https://4ttrail.wordpress.com/take-a-hike/\" class=\"linkified\">https://4ttrail.wordpress.com/take-a-hike/</a></p>",

We can pay when we show up.</p> <p>For those ladies who came to our last brew event, Big Brew Day, our beer that we brewed (Cascadian Dark Ale) is ready to taste. Also, our head brewer, Brandon, said we can add glitter to our CDA as a test run to see how it will look.</p> <p>Lastly, WHEN WILL OUR BEER BE READY? canning and labeling day is scheduled for June 11, 2018. I will post a separate event with details.</p> <p>The Homebrew Exchange is also home to Look Long Brewing. They open the taproom at Noon for full beer pours or tasters.

      "description": "<p>If you are brand new to the group, please read all the way to the bottom of this note. Thanks!</p> <p>This is a good place to play games, get good food and drinks. Please patronize them. Game Knight Lounge is two blocks East of Legacy Hopspital at 3037 N. Williams Ave, cross street Monroe, walk South on Williams one business (on West side of street). Between Legacy and highway 99E on N. Williams Ave, cross street Monroe. There is a small parking lot which we can use on Saturdays. Also, street parking nearby. Get there early and you'll probably get street parking right in front. We'll start playing as soon as we can decide on a game. As others show up they can start another game.</p> <p>Please note that there is a $4 cover charge paid to the restaurant to play games. I always patronize a place where I play games. (There were too many gamers who didn't purchase anything at all.)</p> <p>CHAD our helper!</p> <p>We have a helper who will be around to greet you especially on Meetup events when I can not be there. This will allow us to run the event nearly every Saturday. Of course, you can always go play games there on Saturday in that time spot, even if we don't announce an event.</p> <p>Why the name Middleweight?</p> <p>Historically, our group has played Middleweight games (less than 2 hours and easy rules that do not require detailed explanation for half the time it takes to play). With so much choice available at the Game Knight Lounge, feel free to agree with those present to play any game you wish.</p> <p>SIGNING UP - PLEASE use the RSVP signup.</p> <p>It is important to use the RSVP function. While you are welcome to come without doing a sign up, it helps the attendance. When people see that others have already signed up, they are more likely to also RSVP.. If you can’t make an event, PLEASE do the right thing (reverse the RSVP) so that one of the people on the Waiting List, has a chance to join the fun.</p> <p>WAITLIST</p> <p>Be patient if you are on the waitlist, Meetup will automatically notify you if a space becomes available. I've set it to 10 for the moment, but we could probably go up to 12 people in the back area. . I'll very likely expand the size of the event if we get into waitlist state. I really like playing games and welcome you to come play.</p> <p>Byron Windhorst</p>",

She found that during her training sessions with reactive dogs there weren't enough triggers within the neighborhood to get the dog the exposure, and repetition it needed to effectively reinforce positive social behaviors. She thought it would be great to have everyone come together to help each other!</p> <p>Pack walk begins with a brief overview of basic desensitization techniques for anyone who needs support or is unsure of what techniques to use for their dog. During this time please maintain 6 ft. from dogs until bandanas are on and we understand each other’s needs. We accept that everyone comes from different backgrounds and different trainers and we encourage you to use techniques that work best for you and your dog. Lyndsi tries to bring new tips each week to ensure that each individual gets the knowledge they need. Please bring your treat pouches and the treats that your dog thinks are the best treats in the whole world!</p> <p>We use a colored bandana system to create a safe environment for both owners and dogs. Bandanas are provided at the beginning of each walk.</p> <p>Green= Dogs who are comfortable being greeted by people and other dogs.</p> <p>Yellow= Dogs who are frightful of people, but comfortable meeting new dogs.</p> <p>Red= Dogs who are reactive with people and other dogs— so we know to give space.</p> <p>This is a journey for both you and your dog!

      "description": "<p>Hi Everyone, please join us for our weekly critique meeting. We are holding this every Saturday afternoon at First Christian Church. They have a great back room that can be closed off from everything and is nice and quiet! No more sound checks or pianos to deal with, so it's an ideal place for reading aloud.</p> <p>We are using a read-aloud format. If you wish to have your work critiqued, please bring a short piece or chapter (about 2-3 double-spaced pages) to read out loud to the group. It can be any genre, including non-fiction or poetry, but we do ask that the material be R as we are in a public place and don't put age restrictions on our writers. You don't have to read - you can show up to listen and critique or just listen. We don't have set time limits on critiques - all we ask is that you be mindful of how many readers are reading after you so that everyone gets a chance to read. We unfortunately have to pay a monthly fee for the space so we will pass a hat. There's no cost to come but if you can spare a couple of dollars it will go to paying for the space.</p> <p>Please RSVP so we have an accurate count so we know how many chairs to set up. Also please note: the building is locked so there will be someone at the Park Avenue entrance (the glass doors) between 1:30 - 2:00 to let you in. Don't be late! If you think you might be a bit late, please message Heather ahead of time so we can make arrangements.</p>",

When we last met the topic was knowledge and certainty, but at my end of the table we circled the question of what makes up human rationality and what hard test cases are. Interesting stuff. Maybe Brandon could give a brief presentation of what his thoughts are on certainty? I'm not sure he got that far last time (philosophers love to talk!!). Also questions of the limits of science were discussed (not be me this time: Yeah!) although more as a practical matter. I'd like to explore more how natural science decreases our understanding of things even as it increases our power over them. Beware of power without understanding!</p> <p>Hope to see you Saturday!</p>",

      "description": "<p>Hello Enlightened Souls,</p> <p>With the full moon comes releasing. This is now the perfect time to not only let go, but for healing. Forgiveness is where it starts. Tonight Michael will help us with Divine Forgiveness, not only that in this life time, but also past lives to include everything and everyone across all time lines.<br/>Come and listen to the Healing Sounds of Crystal Pyramids that reach every part of your being and cells, while providing harmonious balance within. These tones set the space and frequencies for the fully guided meditation. For those who are new, please know I personally guide all meditations while channeling Divine Energies. ( I am totally present and aware during energy channeling... It's Energy).</p> <p>Preparing For The Meetup :<br/>The Space is cleared with Holy Wood, Crystals are placed in the room, and all 7 Chakra Tibetan Singing Bowls are usually used before (or during) we start the meditation to bring us into a more synchronized balanced state. We often use the Healing Crystal Pyramids for Sound Healing as well. If you have never experienced Divine~Angel Healing before, then your in for a Unique Experience.</p> <p>Please know this is a \"SPIRITUAL\" Group, and Not Religious. However the Group works well with religion too. There is no judgement here in our group. Whatever Universal Energy you believe in works here too. I simply channel the Highest Universal Energy into the room for everyone to experience. This is how I am of Service today. It's a beautiful and loving feeling for me!!</p> <p>A bit about Sacred Wings:</p> <p>I have been guided by the Angels, Universal Spirit, and Masters to be of service to those who would like \"Their\" help. Their presence is always here at my home. However, the energy of their powerful presence will meld with your higher self (Spirit) during the meditation and will infuse their healing love throughout your being and into your heart core.</p> <p>Healing Meditations can help you in areas where there maybe lower vibration blocks; Hurt, forgiveness issues, relationship issues, fear, doubt, negativity, insecurity, and more. Angel Healing meditations will be unique to each individual and in raising your vibration/frequency. Your \"Intent\", to ask and receive healing, is Everything. You will also be practicing \"The Art of Allowing\" and \"Co-Creating\" in becoming \"A Master of Your Own Creation\".</p> <p>We will share about our meditation experience afterwards (if you feel comfortable). This sharing helps us all in enlightening and connecting with each other as the Spiritual Beings that we are.</p> <p>If you would like to invite more than 1 extra guest please try &amp; let me know so I know how many will be attending in total for the group. Cost is $10.00 per person. If you have any questions and would like my phone number, just message me and I'll send it to you.</p> <p>Additional Parking on the Side Street ~ 39th Ave. The back wooden gate will be open on the right side of side street. Follow the deck to the 2nd sliding door where you can enter the house. You may park in our driveway, but it only holds 4 vehicles. I try to save driveway for those who have mobility issues.</p> <p>Love &amp; Light, Alicia</p>",

Spots are only held for those who pay in advance.***</p> <p>Dining alfresco is a treat during the summer months in Portland and this dining experience will be like visiting the home of old Italian friends and eating in the style of an Italian family. While my husband was born in Genoa—moving to Portland as a boy—I'm a member of one of the oldest Italian families in the city of Portland.</p> <p>Since childhood I've enjoyed cooking, and in a former life I was married to a chef and sommelier who is also a wine grower and winemaker. I learned a lot of kitchen tricks during that decade of my life to say the least!</p> <p>This will be the third summer of my dinners. Several years ago I needed a creative way to pay for a sudden back surgery (Posterior Cervical Laminectomy) and I'm grateful these dinners helped me achieve that goal! Since then the garden and kitchen have both grown and changed quite a bit so I want to do this again.</p> <p>I've continued to work in horticulture too and have branched out a bit into garden design.</p> <p>So, what can you expect? It's 4 courses for $40. I use the best local ingredients—including garden-grown fare from our organic community garden plot—and I make virtually everything from scratch here in my home kitchen. Wine is not included. Bottles are typically brought and shared by guests and we've oddly never run out!</p> <p>Payment is made in advance.<br/>Seating is limited and reservations are held for those who pay in advance. If you RSVP, payment must be made as soon as possible.</p> <p>Please use this link to pay through PayPal: <a href=\"http://paypal.me/LaDolceDinner/40\" class=\"linkified\">http://paypal.me/LaDolceDinner/40</a></p> <p>Our home is old, bohemian, and we're proudly part of Old Portland living at the base of Mt Tabor.

      "description": "<p>It's that time of year again! Parade season! One of portlands largest parade, the starlight parade is probably my favorite.</p> <p>I'm also asking for the people going if they can generously bring some kind of fruit or vegetables to share. Up don't have to bring a bunch but for example like 3-4 apples, oranges, bananas, grapes strawberries, baby carrots, couple of crowns of broccoli, pineapple plums cherry tomatoes.</p> <p>Due to a members request, we will allow chocolate and cheese.</p> <p>I will have a knife, cutting board and trays to set the food in as well as ranch. Please no junk food.<br/>I would like to have everyone share something we won't feel so guilty about eating.</p> <p>Floats with lights on them make this experience a very fun and family friendly event so if you have a little one, bring them too!</p> <p>We're going to do it like we did it last year right in front of the rialto. When I say in front, I mean literally 5 feet in front of the entrance. People got lost last year so let me make it very specific. Head towards the entrance. Turn 180 degrees with the door to your back. The people directly in front of you close to the curb and possibly on to the street is where we will be at.</p> <p>The parade doesn't start until 8:30. Please don't be late or you may not even be able to walk through the crowds of people. Over 325,000 people attend this event.</p> <p>If you plan on socializing, I would recommend showing up early and chat while we wait. As soon as its parade time it's hard to hear each other.</p> <p>I also need help from people who feel like drinking to show up around the time I posted. Rialto puts benches outside out front where you can legally sit and drink and watch the parade. I want to take over as many tables as we can.</p> <p>You can also bring a chair or a small blanket to place on the ground to sit on. That or an old coat you can put on the curb and sit on.</p> <p>Parking? Good luck. Even if you find a spot, getting out is bumper to bumper. I've seen people park in those parking structures and they get grid locked. Imagine over 300,000 people filling the streets going every which way to get home.</p> <p>The jams usually happen from pedestrians crossing in the crosswalk and the drivers unable to maneuver. If you do park, park as far away as you can humanly walk from. Trust me.</p> <p>That or do what I do. Take transit. Park at a transit station and take it in. It's fast and efficient.</p> <p>This event is being cross promoted in 3 other groups: People in the city, 20/30s social drinkers club &amp; Single professionals happy hour. The extra rsvps is reflecting the combine total of the 3 other groups.</p>",

      "description": "<p>It's that time of year again! Parade season! One of portlands largest parade, the starlight parade is probably my favorite.</p> <p>I'm also asking for the people going if they can generously bring some kind of fruit or vegetables to share. Up don't have to bring a bunch but for example like 3-4 apples, oranges, bananas, grapes strawberries, baby carrots, couple of crowns of broccoli, pineapple plums cherry tomatoes.</p> <p>Due to a members request, we will allow chocolate and cheese.</p> <p>I will have a knife, cutting board and trays to set the food in as well as ranch. Please no junk food.<br/>I would like to have everyone share something we won't feel so guilty about eating.</p> <p>Floats with lights on them make this experience a very fun and family friendly event so if you have a little one, bring them too!</p> <p>We're going to do it like we did it last year right in front of the rialto. When I say in front, I mean literally 5 feet in front of the entrance. People got lost year so let me make it very specific. Head towards the entrance. Turn 180 degrees with the door to your back. The people directly in front of you close to the curb and possibly on to the street is where we will be at.</p> <p>The parade doesn't start until 8:30. Please don't be late or you may not even be able to walk through the crowds of people. Over 325,000 people attend this event.</p> <p>If you plan on socializing, I would recommend showing up early and chat while we wait. As soon as its parade time it's hard to hear each other.</p> <p>I also need help from people who feel like drinking to show up around the time I posted. Rialto puts benches outside out front where you can legally sit and drink and watch the parade. I want to take over as many tables as we can.</p> <p>You can also bring a chair or a smash blanket to place on the ground to sit on. That or an old coat you can put on the curb and sit on.</p> <p>Parking? Good luck. Even if you find a spot, getting out is bumper to bumper. I've seen people park in those parking structures and they get grid locked. Imagine over 300,000 people filling the streets going every which way to get home.</p> <p>The jams usually happen from pedestrians crossing in the crosswalk and the drivers unable to maneuver. If you do park, park as far away as you can humanly walk from. Trust me.</p> <p>That or do what I do. Take transit. Park at a transit station and take it in. It's fast and efficient.</p> <p>This event is being cross promoted in 3 other groups: People in that city, Single professionals happy hour &amp; Anyone can join. The extra rsvps is reflecting the combine total of the 3 other groups.</p>",

There are always new folks in attendance as well as experienced dancers who will be happy to show you the ropes. Please RSVP so folks who are shy about showing up alone will know they are among friends! Tonight’s contra dance features caller David Kaynor from Massachusetts and local band The Stage Crew (Sue Songer, Lanny Martin, Lori Shaffer).</p> <p>As always there will be a lesson for newcomers at 7:30 and the dancing will start at 8 pm. At around 9:30, we’ll have a waltz, then a break, then more dancing until we end at 11 with a final waltz. Afterwards, we’ll adjourn to the Hillsdale Pub (1505 SW Sunset Blvd) for socializing with friends old and new. It’s fine to come by yourself, as you’ll find plenty of partners on the dance floor! Contra dancing is aerobic so dress accordingly and wear comfortable shoes preferably with suede or leather soles (or you can wear any kind of shoes with a sock pulled over them!)</p> <p>Cost: $6 for students/seniors, $8 general admission. Please bring cash or check.</p>",

Open Friday and Saturday nights, Thunder Alley combines all the fun of ten-pin bowling with all the excitement of a black light rave (minus the furry leg warmers and fishnet tank tops, thankfully). Our last experience here was an incredibly fun time, and I for one am pumped for the return trip. If you only attend one after-dark bowling Meetup event in the Vancouver area this week, make it this one.</p> <p>SCHEDULE:</p> <p>8:00 PM - Arrive at the Cedar Room Lounge (located inside Hazel Dell Lanes) to socialize, eat, have a drink, and/or sing some karaoke.</p> <p>9:30 PM - Thunder Alley opens and bowling begins! Cost is $14 per person, which includes shoe rental and unlimited bowling until 12:30.</p> <p>12:30 AM - Thunder Alley concludes. If enough folks are up for it, we'll head somewhere else for even more good times. Saturday night only happens once a week, after all.</p>",

The Tillamook tribe believed their most powerful god resided at this peak. Neahkahnie translates into Ne (\"place of\") Ekahnie (\"supreme deity\").</p> <p>Soon after starting the hike, you'll have ocean views. Then, it's off into beautiful forested area until we reach the peak. The hike is around 6 miles roundtrip. We won't be taking the long loop because we need to get back for those epic eats I promised you.</p> <p>After looking down on the beach in Manzanita, we're going to drive into that little city and have lunch at Bread and Ocean. They offer quiche, frittatas, polentas, sandwiches, soups, and salads. And then there's the tall dessert case. The desserts vary, but you may come across an orange walnut roll, cinnamon roll, a macaroon covered in chocolate and almonds, and several sweet and gooey bars that will have you salivating.</p> <p>We'll meet at Foothills Park and carpool from there. I can take a few people in my car. If anyone will volunteer to drive additional vehicles, if needed, please comment below. For non-drivers, please provide your driver with $5 for gas/transportation costs. I'm guessing that this trip will last 7 1/2 hours. We depart shortly after the meet time, so please be on time.</p> <p>So, come out and your whole life will change for the better. Your parents will be more proud of you than they already are. Your dog will look at you more adoringly. You'll be able to live in Portland rent free. That guy you've wanted to ask you out will finally ask you out. You won't have to shower for weeks and will still smell great. You'll inherit a million dollars. Okay, I'm not promising any of that will happen, but wouldn't it be great if it did?</p> <p>Driver directions to trailhead:<br/><a href=\"http://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/North_Neahkahnie_Mountain_Trailhead\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/North_Neahkahnie_Mountain_Trailhead</a></p>",

      "description": "<p>PLEASE READ THE FULL DESCRIPTION BELOW!!!</p> <p>I discovered this place while working on a soon-to-be-published map of it for OSU, and was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was...sort of Corvallis' answer to Portland's Forest Park. Expect about 12-13 miles (give or take) of trail hiking, mostly through forest but with some meadows &amp; open spaces thrown in, with maybe 1500 feet of total elevation gain (I'm still deciding which trails to do). Some of it will be new to me too. Should be a good day out, discovering an area I'm betting few of us even knew existed!</p> <p>THE OUTING</p> <p>Rating: Moderate...all on maintained trails. None of the individual trails is more than 3.5 miles long, so we'll be tying a few of them together and maybe doing a short drive between them (or maybe even a car shuttle).</p> <p>Elevation gain: Unknown, but I'm anticipating maybe 1500 feet of total elevation gain.</p> <p>Hike distance: roughly 12-13 miles</p> <p>Hiking time: 5 hours, give or take</p> <p><a href=\"http://cf.forestry.oregonstate.edu/mcdonald-forest-trails\" class=\"linkified\">http://cf.forestry.oregonstate.edu/mcdonald-forest-trails</a><br/>(no, these are not my maps!)</p> <p>We'll meet at Barbur Blvd Park &amp; Ride at 830am and carpool to the trailhead, roughly 90 mins away (75 miles).</p> <p>We should be hiking by 1030am, and finished by late afternoon. I plan to stop for food and drink in either Corvallis or Albany on the return to Portland. I'd anticipate being back in Portland no later than 8pm, but as always I can't guarantee it. If you really need to be back by a specific time, please don't sign up!</p> <p>MORE DETAILS (please read them!)</p> <p>My hiking style: I'm a pretty tireless hiker, but I do pause for photos, views, and snack breaks. I generally focus on enjoying the surroundings rather than reaching the 'finish line' at an aggressive pace. I like keeping the group somewhat together on the trail and not leaving anyone behind. Most of all, I want it to be an enjoyable day out for everyone!</p> <p>Total driving distance: roughly 170 miles round-trip.</p> <p>Costs: Suggested $15 per person to driver for gas (may vary depending on each car's gas mileage).</p> <p>What to bring: a positive attitude and a sense of adventure, hiking shoes (trail runners are fine for this outing), sunscreen, at least 2 liters of water, snacks (and lunch) for the trail, camera, cash for your driver. Dress in layers (bring a waterproof layer just in case), and leave the cotton at home. I always strongly encourage you to have the 'ten essentials' along (see The Fine Print below), regardless of the difficulty of the hike.</p> <p>Sorry, no dogs...</p> <p>* The 'ten essentials' to always have in your pack generally include: Map/compass (and advance understanding of where you're going!), sun protection, extra clothes, extra food, extra water, headlamp/flashlight (and spare batteries), first aid kit, matches/firestarter, knife/tools, and a whistle if you need to signal for help. You should always be prepared in case you get separated from the rest of the group and/or have to spend a night on your own in the wilderness.</p> <p>* As a Meetup organizer, I'm an unpaid volunteer. While I always try to ensure a safe and enjoyable outing for everyone, by signing up for this event you assume full responsibility for your own health, safety, and well-being for its entire duration, including while traveling to and from both the meeting place and destination.</p>",

It's a great way to have real, focused dialogue and we often discuss matters of agile, lean and such - but anything goes. As far as the mechanics, here's the template:</p> <p>Step 1: Everybody writes down proposed topics on stickies, placing them in the center of the table. Take as much time as needed, but typically takes only 3-5 minutes (or whenever coffee is ready).</p> <p>Step 2: Each topic is briefly described by its writer to get a flavour for the subject (15-30 seconds typically per sticky).</p> <p>Step 3: Each person gets a small number of votes which they indicate by marking the voted-for sticky with their sharpie (all votes on one, one across many, however you feel).</p> <p>Step 4: The top stickies are placed in the ToDo column, ordered by the stickies with the most votes at the top.</p> <p>Step 5: Each of these stickies are discussed for 5 minutes, most votes first. The facilitator takes a quick \"Cesar\" (thumbs up/down) vote at the five-minute timer, and she moves on for three more minutes if the discussion still has majority interest. When complete, move the sticky over to the Done column. Rinse and repeat.</p> <p>Step 6: wrap-up thoughts at the end - what one idea or person did you most enjoy, then break for home/drinks/cover.</p>",

The 1st is a review of David Reich’s career work with ancient human DNA, from the New York Times’ ‘Profiles in Science’ posted in March a week before the publication of his new book, “Who We Are and How We Got Here”. The 2nd is an opinion piece by Reich himself discussing the scientific and social implications, and potential misuses, of this burgeoning field.</p> <p>“David Reich Unearths Human History Etched in Bone”<br/><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/science/david-reich-human-migrations.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/science/david-reich-human-migrations.html</a></p> <p>“How Genetics Is Changing Our Understanding of ‘Race’”<br/><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/opinion/sunday/genetics-race.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/opinion/sunday/genetics-race.html</a></p> <p>“I am worried that well-meaning people who deny the possibility of substantial biological differences among human populations are digging themselves into an indefensible position, one that will not survive the onslaught of science. I am also worried that whatever discoveries are made — and we truly have no idea yet what they will be — will be cited as “scientific proof” that racist prejudices and agendas have been correct all along, and that those well-meaning people will not understand the science well enough to push back against these claims.<br/>This is why it is important, even urgent, that we develop a candid and scientifically up-to-date way of discussing any such differences, instead of sticking our heads in the sand and being caught unprepared when they are found.” –David Reich</p> <p>If you're interested, here are two brief reviews that include some of the book's major points about specific populations:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/29/who-we-are-how-got-here-david-reich-ancient-dna-review\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/29/who-we-are-how-got-here-david-reich-ancient-dna-review</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/books/review/david-reich-who-we-are-how-we-got-here.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/books/review/david-reich-who-we-are-how-we-got-here.html</a></p> <p>~Michael</p>",

Mandatory for all riders: Helmets must be worn at all times while riding. This is a requirement and not a request.</p> <p>Please review each ride and determine which is the appropriate for your skill level. If any questions or suggestions, you are always welcome to message me through the site and ask. Always bring plenty of water, snacks for energy. Bring a flat repair kit, including a spare tube tool kit and pump and be prepared to change your own tire but know we will always help you if needed. Obey traffic laws. Be a good steward of your cycling community. Working lights are mandatory for all evening and night rides.</p> <p>No Earbuds. No exceptions.</p> <p>Make sure your bike is in good mechanical condition to start the ride.</p> <p>Nobody gets left behind. No one will be dropped from the ride. Our goal is we all get back to the start point safe and sound.</p> <p>We do not use the term “all clear” when crossing intersections.</p> <p>Conditions can change quickly. When “Car Back” is called, it means single file. These and other terms will be discussed at rides start. Each rider is responsible for his or her own safety and is expected to ride in a safe group riding manner, which does not create a danger to others.</p> <p>Manage your RSVP’s</p> <p>The number of riders for each ride are limited by the event host, and based on the experience of the participants, the course, and conditions. If you sign up for the ride, and your schedule changes, you must change your RSVP to NO. This will allow riders on the waiting list to fill the vacancy and enjoy the ride. Please don’t wait till the last minute. We will track no shows. Those who repeatedly “no show” may be moved to the bottom of the wait list.</p> <p>RSVP’s cannot include a “plus one” or guest. Every participant must be a member of CycleManiacs, and thereby in acceptance of the release and waiver of liability terms.</p> <p>RELEASE AND WAIVER OF LIABILITY</p> <p>By participating in any posted event, you're taking responsibility for your own safety.

Some of our burdens are named ones: depression, anxiety, loss, addiction, shame, religious guilt, codependency, physical illness, etc….. Some of our pains are unnamed. What they all seem to have in common, however, is that they make us feel like we don’t belong, tearing us away from the present moment and the 'now'.</p> <p>Eventually, we seem to figure out somewhere along the journey that it is better to embrace openness and vulnerability in dealing with these challenges, rather than trod a path of hiddenness and repression. Though this road is not necessarily easy, its travelers slowly begin to feel and claim their purpose and connectedness………</p> <p>The Outlier Gang is a meetup that allows us to safely share our stories about how we deal with named or unnamed struggles, what tools, guides or practices have helped us along our journeys, and how to explore potential creative ways that help turn any seeming weaknesses into strengths for us and others…………</p> <p>The only agenda is to listen, share, and honor each story, with some good tea or coffee............</p>",

All five senses will will be focused on individually throughout the course of this journey.</p> <p>We will start with some light breathing to help us clear our mind from outside influences and instead, be present. It is recommended that electronic devices be left in vehicles or put on silent mode. Light conversation is encouraged but please respect other bathers.</p> <p>After some light breathing, and one or two standing yoga poses, we’ll begin our journey. Throughout our walk I may pause the group so that we may all focus on one of the five senses. It is purposeful to close our eyes during these pauses, breathing and then re-Opening our eyes.</p>",
